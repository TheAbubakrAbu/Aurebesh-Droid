# Aurebesh Droid - Discord Bot

**Aurebesh Droid** is a fully functional Discord bot that brings the iconic Star Wars writing system, **Aurebesh**, to life. Inspired by the droids and datapads of the Star Wars universe, it serves as a language translator, an immersive lore companion, and a platform for Star Wars-inspired features.

The bot includes dynamic **Jedi and Sith holocrons** that unlock hidden wisdom from across the galaxy, adding a rich layer of interactivity and mystery to the experience.
